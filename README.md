[Family Feud] is a quiz show where two teams play against eachother to score points by guessing the most popular responses to survey questions given to random people. The team that has the most points at the end of four rounds plays a bonus round called Fast Money, where they get a chance to win a cash bonus.

This version features special holiday themed survey questions.

## Gameplay

### Setup

The game starts with a board displayed with a number of response options for a survey question. The board has two columns and four rows. The concealed response in the top left corner of the board is the most popular response to the survey question. The responses continue ordered by popularity down the first column and then into the second. The first round will usually have the most responses and the number of responses decreases each round.

Each response on the board has a point value. This value represents the number of people out of 100 who named this response to the survey question. Therefor, the more popular questions are worth more points. During the first two rounds, the points are awarded at face value. In the third round, point values are doubled. In the forth round, point values are tripled.

### Head-to-head
Traditionally, the game starts with a head-to-head round with one player from each team facing off against eachother to buzz in to guess a response from the board. If the person who buzzes in first guesses the top response on the board, their team wins the face-off and gets to guess the rest of the responses on the board. If that person's guess is not the top answer or if their guess is not on the board, the other person in the head-to-head gets to guess. The person who has the highest scored answer wins and that person's team gets to play the rest of the round.

### Team play
The team plays one player at a time, each person trying to guess a response on the board. If player's guess is on the board, it is revealed and the points from that response are awarded to the team, and then the next player on the team guesses. This continues until the board is fully guessed or there are three strikes against the team. A strike is received when an incorrect answer is given, or if an answer is not given before the timer runs out.

### Winning the round
If the original team gets three strikes and there are still unrevealed responses on the board, then the other team has a chance to steal their points by correctly identifying a response on the board. If, however, they do not answer correctly, or if they do not respond before the timer expires, then the points are awarded to the original team. After the points are awarded for the round, the remaining concealed answers are revealed.

After each round, a new head-to-head round is played with different players from the previous head-to-heads, and the rounds continue with the same rules. The team with the most points at the end of the four rounds gets to play Fast Money.

### Fast Money

Fast money is played with two people from the same team. The first person is given 20 seconds to guess the top answer from 5 different categories. The round is over once they answer all five questions, or when the time runs out.

Then, the second person, who did not see the categories or the guesses of the first person, has to guess the same categories. If the second person guesses the same answer as the first person, they will be prompted to guess again. The second person gets 25 seconds to guess instead of 20.

The categories in the fast money round are also scored based on 100 answers. The most frequent response to a category yields the highest number of points. The goal of fast money is to earn 200 points between the two players to win. The prize for winning the Fast Money round is $20,000, or whatever programming points you want to offer.
